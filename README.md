## Project Overview

This project involves creating a visually appealing web page based on a design provided by The Odin Project. The primary goal is to faithfully replicate the design while ensuring proper functionality. The project is divided into several key steps.

## Specifications

Here are some of the specifications of the project:

- **Structuring the Page:** The HTML page is structured according to the design layout.

- **Text Readability:** Behind the "ODIN" logo, a div with a dark, semi-transparent background color is implemented. This enhances text readability against the busy background image.

- **Button Color:** Used the color #596D48 for the 'Create Account' button. This color complements the tones found in the background image.

- **Input Fields:** Input fields are customized as follows:
  - Selected input fields have a blue border and subtle box-shadow.

- **Password Validation:** JavaScript is implemented to check if password fields match each other.
